## Generate Example Cubes

First, install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt` using the terminal. 

Then to generate a cube with `dims` dimensions and `obs` observations, type in the terminal `py generate_example dims obs` with the two arguments being some integers.
The resulting cube will be generated and saved in the examples directory.
